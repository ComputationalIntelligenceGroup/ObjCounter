The plugin detects the objects, and it can create stacks with the labelled objects, stacks with centroid or center of masses of the detected objects, and it can exports the results to csv format. Moreover if an overlay (with single dots labelling every objects) is present than it is possible to evaluate the segmentation.\r\n\r\nObjCounter is based partly on _3D_Object_Counter code by Fabrice P. Cordeli√®res (http://imagej.net/3D_Objects_Counter).\r\nThe algorithm to connect the objects is completely different to achieve better performance.\r\nMoreover the logic is different, the connection is done in every slice, then based on the intersection between objects in \r\ndifferent slices the objects are linked or not (modifying the fraction parameter change the tolerance to connections, e.g. with fraction=0 all the possible connections will be made).\r\n\r\nThe _3D_OC_Options class is the same as used in _3D_Object_Counter plugin, and should not cause any conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Installation and dependencies\r\n\r\nObjCounter is an ImageJ plugin, thus ImageJ must be installed (see http://fiji.sc/ to install FIJI a \"batteries-included\" distribution of ImageJ).\r\n\r\nTo install the plugin just copy the .JAR file into the plugin directory of your ImageJ installation.\r\n\r\n",
